Welcome to the ATM Interface repository! This project provides a simple ATM interface implemented in Java. Users can perform banking operations such as depositing funds, withdrawing cash, and checking balances through a user-friendly command-line interface. The repository consists of two main classes: BankAccount and Atm, which handle account functionalities and ATM operations, respectively.

BankAccount Class:

Manages the account balance and provides methods for depositing and withdrawing funds.
Ensures validity checks for deposit and withdrawal amounts.
Allows users to check their account balance.
Atm Class:

Facilitates user interaction by displaying options for deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.
Implements methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance based on user input.
Ensures smooth navigation through the ATM menu.
Usage:

Instantiate a BankAccount object with an initial balance.
Create an Atm object, passing the BankAccount object as a parameter.
Call the start() method of the Atm object to begin the ATM interface.
